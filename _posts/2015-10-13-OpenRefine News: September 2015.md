We are thrilled to share with you some updates from our end, new and exciting developments that have been happening with the community in September, the buzz around the new online [OpenRefine Foundation](http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/introduction-to-openrefine/) course.

## New Course and Article

[RefinePro](http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/introduction-to-openrefine/) launched the new Online OpenRefine Foundation Course, to assist in the learning of basic data science by providing structure and direction to the students. This course lets you learn the basics of OpenRefine and data manipulation in only 7 hours. There are a total of 23 instructional videos and 7 hands-on labs split into 5 challenging lessons.

[Rob Worthington](http://blog.kwantu.net/author/rob-worthington) wrote an interesting and content filled article this month, on [how to clean up messy data](http://blog.kwantu.net/how-to-clean-up-messy-data-using-open-refine?utm_campaign=KM&utm_content=20726810&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) using OpenRefine. Great step by step tutorial to find, remove duplicates, group similar data and lots more for new users.

In his latest tutorial, [Tony Hirst](http://blog.ouseful.info/author/psychemedia/) shows how to [convert Spreadsheet Rows to Text Based Summary Reports Using OpenRefine](http://blog.ouseful.info/2015/09/04/converting-spreadsheet-rows-to-text-based-summary-reports-using-openrefine/)

#####In German  
Good article about @OpenRefine and the [handling of large amounts of data](http://www.tanner.de/blog/datenanalyse-und-optimierung-mit-openrefine-3/) released, by [Alexander Witzigmann](http://www.tanner.de/blog/author/alexanderwitzigmann/).

##### In Mandarin
Really interesting to see how the community had come a long way and now the reach is on a global scale.  Check [@tzangms](https://twitter.com/tzangms) using [OpenRefine to show how you can use facets and filters.](http://blog.infographics.tw/2015/09/openrefine-introduction/)

## Up Coming Workshop and Events

[Linked Open Data in Libraries Archives and Museums (LODLAM)](http://lodlam.net/) services as a borderless network of enthusiasts, technicians, professionals and any number of other people who are interested in or working with Linked Open Data pertaining to galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. Currently looking for workshop leaders that can run various conferences throughout 2015-16 teaching [LODLAM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Az8ylu76m-bcSDhgYVf-31s2-OLOkHmvSx5k_I9a-no/viewform), if you have time and the knowledge this would help a lot of people.  

[Introduction to OpenRefine at Central PA Open Source Conference](http://cposc.org/sessions/introduction-to-openrefine/) 2015-10-17 by Heather Myers. Data is always a hot topic, this conference is to educate and talk about cleaning this data. Increased demand for this product leads to more and more workshops, which is really good to see. 

[DVS Workshop: OpenRefine: Data Mining and Transformations, Text Normalization](http://calendar.duke.edu/events/show?fq=id%3ACAL-8a0870ef-4f40a47f-014f-43b8961b-00006e91demobedework%40mysite.edu)  Oct 20, 2015 at Duke University.

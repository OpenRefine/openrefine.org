**OpenRefine is seeking a new member for its Advisory Committee (volunteer position).**

Starting in 2019, OpenRefine explored a new sustainability model by leveraging grants and corporate sponsorship. Three years into that process, OpenRefine is now fiscally sponsored by Code for Science & Society Inc and secured four significant grants from three different organizations. As a result, the project matured with the creation of the Advisory, Steering, and Code of Conduct committees and started hiring contractors to advance our roadmap. During that time, we went through tremendous growth as we doubled the number of active contributors, increased the number of languages translated, and continued to see more users relying on OpenRefine.

Today we are looking for new advisory committee member(s) to support our new model, strengthen our governance and continue to engage at an organizational level with our partners and community. 

The advisory committee member(s) primary responsibility is to oversee the project and coordinate with Code for Science & Society for its operations. So far, the advisory committee has had most of the executive responsabilities, which are 
* Manage grant application, 
* Oversee hiring and management of contractor 
* Prepare and approve budget
* Work with the steering committee to establish strategic partnership with other communities and organization.

In the next two years, we also want
* Improve our governance and community diversity;
* Renew our Advisory and Steering Committee, focusing on bringing users and institutions into the project's governance
* Formalizing the project roadmap;
* Ensuring the projectâ€™s financial sustainability by searching for new sources of funding;

We are looking into hiring a project director to support the advisory committee in those missions (see [the corresponding job posting for
details](https://openrefine.org/blog/2021/11/05/Project-director.html)).


## About the position

We are seeking at least one new advisory committee member to help us move along the goals describe above and bring their perspective on how OpenRefine should evolve. 

This position is for you if you:
* Care deeply about the future of OpenRefine;
* Have good communication skills in English;
* Are able to join a monthly call with Code for Science and Society where we coordinate the project's operations.
* Be ready to invest at least 3h per months (between calls and document review).

This is a volunteer (non paid) position.

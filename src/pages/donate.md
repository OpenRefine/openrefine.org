# Support OpenRefine
## Why Your Support Matters

OpenRefine is a free, power tool for working with messy data and improving it. Our mission is to empower everyone to meaningfully engage with data by providing an accessible, open-source tool and nurturing a diverse, supportive community. Your sponsorship fills the funding gap beyond grants, ensuring the project remains healthy and community-driven. You can make a one-time gift or become a monthly sponsor at any level.

# OpenRefine extensions

You can install the following extensions to add functionalities to OpenRefine. We do not vouch for the function of any of these extensions. Some only work with earlier version of OpenRefine, or with third-party distributions. See [how to install an extension](https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/installing#installing-extensions).

## Reconciliation services

OpenRefine can connect to several reconciliation services. You can find information about them at:
* [Reconcilable Data Sources](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Reconcilable-Data-Sources) in our wiki
* [Reconciliation Software](https://reconciliation-api.github.io/census/services/) at the Reconciliation API Census
* [Reconciliation Services](https://reconciliation-api.github.io/testbench/#/) at the Reconciliation API testbench (generated by a [SPARQL query on Wikidata](https://w.wiki/5agG))

## Client libraries

You can automate some OpenRefine operations using one of the existing libraries. Those libraries are using the [OpenRefine API](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/OpenRefine-API).

## Version 3.7

## Vulnerabilities

* (from 3.7.8 on) The fix of the vulnerability below was fixed, as it did not prevent the exploit using a particular URL syntax for the JDBC server. The vulnerability was assigned identifier CVE-2024-23833. We thank @l0n3rs for disclosing it to us.
* (from 3.7.5 on) A moderate vulnerabilities in the database extension was fixed. Connecting to a malicious MySQL server could read files or execute arbitrary code on the machine running OpenRefine. The vulnerabilities were assigned CVE-2023-41886 and CVE-2023-41887
  identifiers respectively, and were reported by @nbxiglk0.
* (from 3.7.4 on) A moderate vulnerability in project import was fixed. Importing a maliciously crafted project could execute arbitrary code on the machine running OpenRefine. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE-2023-37476 identifier. It was reported by Stefan Schiller from SonarSource.

### New features
* Most text exposed to users in OpenRefine's UI can now be translated. Some strings (generated server-side) were not translatable so far. To help translators catch up on this backlog, do not hesitate to [join us on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/openrefine/). ([#5030](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/5030))
* New media files can be uploaded to Wikibase instances such as Wikimedia Commons. The wikitext of existing files can also be edited thanks to the new fields introduced. ([#4682](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/4682))
* A button "Discover Wikibase instancesâ€¦" was added on the dialog which lists the registered Wikibase instances ([#5007](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5007)), whose design was improved ([#5009](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5009))

* The Wikibase issues tab now makes it possible to locate which rows are responsible for certain issues, using facets ([#5033](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5033))
* The default throttle delay for the "Add column by fetching URLs" operation was reduced to 500ms and the error reporting for this field was improved ([#5188](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5188))
* Wikibase templates (incomplete Wikibase schemas) can be saved and shared, as a way of helping contributors use the same way of structuring data in a Wikibase instance ([#5043](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5043), [#5303](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/5303))
* The line-based importer now supports a custom delimiter, instead of only newlines ([#4103](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/4103))
* The Excel importer can be configured to import all cells as text, disabling the use of other datatypes supported by OpenRefine ([#4838](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/4838))
* The "some value" and "no value" Wikibase values can now be uploaded by OpenRefine ([#5360](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/5360))
* The Excel importer will also avoid coercing cell values to OpenRefine datatypes which do not fully fit them, such as representing a date as a date with time ([#5389](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5389), [#5390](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5390)).

* A new `parent` GREL function, to obtain the parent element of an XML element, was added ([#5176](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5176))

### For extension developers

* (from 3.6-rc1 on) We migrated to jQuery 3.6.0. If you are using jQuery in your extension, some jQuery syntaxes that have been deprecated earlier might have been removed. If your extension runs with OpenRefine 3.5.2, you can check the web developer console for warning messages when the extension is used: fixing those should be enough for your extension to be compatible with OpenRefine 3.6 ([#4891](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/4891))

## Version 3.5

### New in 3.5.1

* It is now possible to go to a page of the project table directly ([#2638](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/2638))
* The pagination sizes offered by the UI can now be configured by setting the `ui.browsing.pageSize` preference to values such as `[100,500,1000,2000]` ([#2624](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/2624))

* The split/join multivalued cells dialogs now remember the last separator used ([#2197](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/2197))
* The `forEach` GREL function works on JSON objects ([#3149](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/3149))
* A new GREL function `wholeText` can be used to extract all the text inside an XML element (including in its children) ([#3180](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/3180))

* Greater numbers of rows per page can now be selected ([#3249](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/3249)) (after 3.5-beta1)

### Incompatible changes

* The behavior of the `unescape` function has changed in CSV mode. Previously it would not remove the first and last quote characters from a string, due to a bug in the supporting library. Now it correctly removes these quotes. `unescape("mystring", "csv")` would return _"mystring"_ previously, but now will return _mystring_.
* The export format for Wikibase dates was adapted to match that of Wikibase itself. For instance, a year precision date was exported as `+1883-01-01T00:00:00Z` before and is now represented as `1883-00-00T00:00:00Z`. Therefore re-uploading statements with dates could potentially create duplicate statements. ([#3694](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/3694))
* The behaviour of the reconciliation operation has changed: cells which could not be reconciled due to a service or network error are simply left unreconciled, instead of being identical to reconciled cells with no candidates ([#3369](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/3369)) (after 3.5-beta1)
* Google authentication was fixed ([#3991](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/3991)) (after 3.5-beta1)

We have built a lot of tools that help with the manipulation of scientific names (which are complex and easy to mispell). These are simple java classes and can be dropped into refine as a jar extension, then accessed via jython operations. 
We've spent a lot of time working on data formats and standardised data fields / definitions to populate aggregators like GBIF (gbif.org), and in the future we may work on extensions to OR that have some awareness of these data standards when importing / transforming / exporting data. Making the JSON defined operations available via ""extract/apply"" fully based on column names rather than indices (used for column insertions) would be useful.
Have you thought about social features to enable the sharing of code snippets and data transformations - perhaps these best handled in github gists / wiki / mailing list but a clearly defined approach would be good. This might fit well with a hosted OR - perhaps a kind of ""graph gist"" (http://gist.neo4j.org/) for open refine - a document that encompasses a defined set of data, the operations that you want to apply and then it shows you the results, step by step.
I am also following the fledgling ""data carpentry"" movement (http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/05/our-first-data-carpentry-workshop.html) with interest as it is important to support the development of better data manipulation skills within my organisation (and the wider field).

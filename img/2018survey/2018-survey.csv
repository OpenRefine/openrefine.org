Excellent for clustering and faceting. Far more useful in reproducible data transformation than Excel.,"I find OpenRefine to be an excellent introductory tool for learning to think like a coder, for rudimentary data transformations, and for initial exploratory steps in reproducible data science. The extensible GREL means an OR user can be accommodated to implement increasingly sophisticated coding steps without getting bogged down in a lot of pedantic coding steps. 

Despite my suggestion (""OR would be awesome if..."", above) and even though I believe this to be true, I'm not convinced making OpenRefine an awesome intermediate coding tool is a good strategic goal -- For my own thinking (which is evolving [I hope]), it seems OpenRefine is a great general tool that has a lot of great general uses especially for beginners and for periodic data transformers who do not identify as coders. But making OR more useful to intermediate and advanced uses might take away from the unique space OR commands within the beginner/generalist category. However, if advancing the utility of OR were something people wanted to tackle, I humbly suggest efforts to improve the reproducible and literate qualities of the history mechanism. The amount of effort spent explaining how to reproduce/perform or expose previous OpenRefine operations is cumbersome and inefficient. Sharing OR operations is confusing to all but the most efficient of OR users.

Beyond those hopefully constructive comments, let me say that I think this product is a great tool for use within the librarian sector. I tend to recommend OR to librarians for data transformations (biggest problem there being that many of the librarians I see have large quantities of data which do not fit well with OR's default memory issues). And I recommend OR to undergraduates with little to no coding experience but who also have advanced HTML parsing needs with esoteric websites (which are often old, idiosyncratic, and highly unstructured when compared to normal modern websites.) 

Lastly, let me note my impression that many librarians have an insurmountable need for reconciliation, an almost equal number of librarians have absolutely no need for reconciliation. Which is to say it seems a useful function for an non-expanding niche base -- hence ideal for managing as an extension. 

Three cheers for OpenRefine and the entire community of developers and users.","had a better expression editor for writing GREL expressions. The small editor box makes advanced GREL inefficient and cumbersome. Additionally, more efficient memory and easier default memory configuration in Windows so as to to use more than 1 GB RAM.

## G2Q00005. Which features, available in an extension or plugin, do you want to see by default in OpenRefine?

* an easy way to choose databases for reconciliation
* any that make it easier to access people names, place names, taxon names, georeferencing, and more clustering, for example: would be great to add ability to use globalnames.org in OpenRefine (contact me nnn@nnn.nnn to talk with software developer) :-)
* Api for easily communicating with openrefine from python or CLI
* Better control for Sources, Qualifiers etc.
* connection to other platforms
* every information which can help to understand why uploading my data to Wikibase is unsuccesful
* Full Python beyond Jython…
* Generally: MUCH better integration of the reconciliation services. The core tool is powerful, but documentation (until recently) was weak. Many of the reconciliation services/code bases seem to have been abandoned. The HELP (email forum) seems very friendly, but the dated nature of some of the plugins/anciliary services is a real handicap. Too often I suspect that investing time in trying a plugin will be poorly spent as a casual review shows the code has issues and hasn't be touched for ages. Perhaps weed out the stuff that has been orphaned and make fewer things work better.
* geocoding, named entity recognition
* Geographic coordinate extraction
* I am quite new to it, so I only knew about the Wikidata one - much to explore before knowing how to answer this
* I didn't know that most of these existed, sadly.
* I don't know enough about them to say.
* I don’t know. I edit Wikidata with OpenRefine but I have no idea what the plug-in or extension already does or where to find it…
* I regularly use the VB-bits extension to cross data between data sets
* Mais linguagens de programação, poxa tirar do open e usar em outro lugar é triste
* more user-friendly (non programmers!) language instead of regex
* Orchid wikidata wikispecies
* OSM wikidata DBpedia LCSH (Library of congress subject headings)
* Please further improve reconciliation and upload to wikidata and the like
* RDF conversion
* RDF export
* Recon services for widely-used vocabs; Wikidata upload
* Reconciliar con vocabularios locales
* reconciliation services
* Several years ago I had difficulty trying to set up and reconcile against cultural heritage services (LCSH, FAST, VIAF), but I haven't tried in recent years and instead have stuck with Wikidata. You've made me curious if it's easier to do now.
* some kind of report that lets me know what went wrong when my data does not upload to wikidata - there is no way to know what went right or wrong. the status reaches 100% but the data doesn't go...
* statistics and basic visualization, a spell-checker for continuous text within a cell
* Support for Python, So I can use some pypi modules by default. Cpython is hard to setup and use with pip.
* the ability to export the links created by reconciliation
* The stats for column, I used to use the extension but it doesn't work in the newer versions.
* There used to be an extension for duplicating current lines, that should be nice to have

* ... could be used instead of QuickStatements (in Wikibase)
* … had a nicer interface
* ... if OpenRefine was connected to globalnames.org API (reconciliatoin service?, plug-in?), ... if OpenRefine could work on larger datasets
* ..stays forever :-) It's a great tool. No current wishes for improvement on my side.
* ..was easier to install (on my Mac) and use
* "It would be awesome if OpenRefine" modernized/made clearer its interface.
* ability to cancel suspiciously long running operation to prevent presumable app crash; duplicates facet on non-blank values only; moving column to specified position (not only +/-1, beginning and end); using multiple specified array elements without repeating the expression (like concatenate [3]+[1] of one value.match); allowing manipulation with null values (like concatenate multiple value.matches without testing them with nonBlank first); easy way to get row index within a record; solving issue #3290; dark mode
* Ability to use and run transformation with python modules
* Allow me to spacialize data on a base map.
* allowed a simple way  to add rows
* allowed API calls beyond get.
* allowed some simple data visualisations

* could be integrated into a Python workflow
* Could be used for georeferencing

* could do limited data vis inline
* could edit *existing* statements and references in Wikidata (update qualifiers, add qualifiers, ... sort of what Wikibase-CLI does now).
* could handle faster uploads to Wikidata
* could have drop down menus with very often used scripts (but there perhaps is a way to find them)
* could have more movie based reconciliation functions (imdb, filmportal.de)

* loads on mobile. :p
* Made it easier for dummies to use API's/reconcile against outside datasets besides Wikidata.
* More easily called apis.
* My main issue is finding help when I have an issue due to my lack of knowledge and coding. But as more wiki folk use the tool the more videos on youtube there are and the more knowledge I gain.
* offered some kind of batch workflows (repeating steps automatically, like: import a bunch of csv, do the same steps to all files and close it again) (I know there are some external approaches, but very complicated)
* offers a language more accessibile than regex
* op een intelligentere manier om kan met datasets waarbij er meerdere data-elementen per rij/id zijn.
* plug ins were more easy to use
* reconciliation was faster and could handle 100's of thousands of records; also it would be nice if at the start of reconciliation it did NOT always pause trying to determine a class/type for the data
* Se dictará en un curso del servicio de reconciliación en español
* supported quick row scrolling and longer edit preview
* To get a dynamic link with Google Sheet
* Updated without a bit of trouble
* Was able to combine seperate csv-files into one by matching on a common identifier

* Would allow me to make pivot table easily
* would allow python or R for syntax based work
* would be a better tool for sentiment analysis
* Would be a bit more easy / less daunting to start with for less tech-savy colleagues.

* would fully support workflows (import and export history as well as multi-project history is missing)
* would have a UI that would be a bit more user friendly for newcomers
* would have drag-and-drop for columns.
* would have some visualization tools
* would help me find more training to learn to use all of it's power. I live in a place where I can't find training for it and I often look for training in other countries that accept foreigners/ people outside their institutions, like last's year Carpentries Data Jam.
* Would link more to the World of Python and R packages
* would make it easier to add new rows and to count columns
* would more easily be accessible to multiple people at the same time
* would offer more Clustering Algorithms.
* would open files like libreoffice does, editing in-file would be time- and space saving for my specific use-cases.
* would work better with imported XML files (i.e. hierarchical data).
* would work on large datasets (datasets with many columns)
* You could easy reconcile against a SPARQL query

## G6Q00001. Anything else you would like to add?

* An excellent piece of software which I wished I'd started using years ago now.
* Continue to do such a great job in supporting this Open marvellous tool!
* "Education - a pool of courses that teach OpenRefine
* (I have several courses where I teach it and always searching for more ideas)
* Thanks for everything"
* Gracias
* Great vital accessible tool. Need to update to current version and play around with updates!
* I am an active OpenStreetMap user & developer and I have never heard about OpenRefine before.
* I am so grateful to have access to this tool, and I hope to be able to contribute to it in one way or another. THANK YOU!!
* I can't think of more ways to help right now, but please continue to communicate opportunities that arise. OpenRefine has helped me in my work so much!
* I have implemented a reconciliation service API for a vocabulary hosting service and a client for a text annotation platform - I think the availability and versatility of this standard could be evangelized better by many parties.
* I have recently found OpenRefine has become very unstable. It may be the size/complexity of my data (67k items for 75ish columns). I am using the latest stable version etc, and my browser is up to date, there is little info on a Mac of what has gone wrong. When it crashes I struggle with a cycle of restart OR, restart browser, restart computer, it normally takes a couple of full cycles to get it working again properly. Some guidance somewhere on the documentation about what to do when it stops working would be useful? Maybe I should always go straight for a full computer restart..
* I use it for a very narrow purpose but that purpose (data cleaning) is very important when I need it. Thank you!
* I want to thank you for creating, maintaining and documenting this tool! I find it invaluable, and have done a lot of data clean-up work I could not have managed otherwise.
* I'm an OpenStreetMap mapper but have never heard of OpenRefine and not using it.
* If it helps to know what I used OpenRefine for, I imported a lot of recent Pakistan census data to Wikidata. I edit OpenStreetMap so being able to keep track of those.locales through wikidata is a useful first step in getting them mapped as well
* Ik vind het jammer dat ik Java moet installeren om open refine te gebruiken
* It is a great tool. It still has the whiff of a tool that might simply blow up though. It isn't easy to install on my Mac (my Mac complains about it bitterly) and certainly doesn't have an intuitive interface. However. once you have worked out what to do with it, it is great.
* It's a great tool! I am sorry that I don't have the time/resources at the moment to help improving it further. I hope answering the survey is at least a little help to you guys.
* Just thank you
* Keep up the good work!
* Long life OpenRefine!
* Nope
* Open Refine has transformed the way I work!
* OpenRefine has made our lives easier!! Thank you :)
* Openrefine has made some of my data cleaning work flows much easier and faster
* OR is a great software that is really useful, but has several really annoying things that make working with it way more complicated than it needs to be: e.g. every time a project is opened (without doing any edits) it updates the last edited info and moves to the top of the list, which is annoying, because I then can not see when I really edited a project for the last time. Another example would be that the export templates get reset between exports. I think it used to be that they remained at least for the session, now it means I have to copy & paste the values for each export.
* Since learning about this tool, I've shown it to others who have never heard of it. I studied engineering and I think it would be a great thing to teach this to engineers, since we are often faced with analyzing spreadsheets of data.

* The OpenRefine tool revolutionizes my ability to expand people's understanding about what software can do for us. It helps me convey to those traditionally managing data in spreadsheets, to understand what they've been missing. And, it helps them going forward to dream much bigger when looking at new software development or asking for new functions in existing software. (I'm not sure developers always love that part \<cheeky grin>). But the ease with which Refine does things like clustering --- always elicits awe and catalyzes rich conversations about what's possible that they never knew before.
* "This is just a technical detail: Removing/reordering columns has a horrible GUI. It should be changed to select all/no columns with checkboxes as it is in the custom tab exporter.
* But for the rest, thanks for your great work!"
* This tool is invaluable to the free culture movement!  Thank you humans for all that you do to support this tool and the broader cultural heritage community.

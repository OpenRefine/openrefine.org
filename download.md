## Other Distributions

The following distributions have been customized for a specific usage or integration with other technologies. 

| Distribution | Description |  Authors |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| [LODRefine](https://github.com/sparkica/LODRefine)    | LODRefine is actually OpenRefine with integrated extensions that make transition from tabular data to Linked Data a bit easier. Integrated extensions are: RDF extension, DBpedia extension, Crowdsourcing extension, Stats extension | Sparkica |

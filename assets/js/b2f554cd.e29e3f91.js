For the first time, we also asked you to give the software a general score. On average, survey respondents gave OpenRefine a solid 8 out of 10! This makes the team very happy, and of course (with your help) we hope to improve this score even more over time.\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-overall-score.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-overall-score.png)\\n\\nNow, on to more details.\\n\\n## Who are you?\\n\\nIn our 2020 survey, librarians (37.64%) formed an overwhelming majority of respondents. This year, we very proactively reached out to many of OpenRefine\'s typical user communities; this has resulted in a more \'even\' distribution of sectors and communities that our survey respondents hailed from. Based on new popular answers in previous surveys, we added a few extra options to the question \\"Which field(s), discipline(s) or community/ies do you most identify with?\\" and respondents could provide more than one answer. Today, librarians are still the largest group of OpenRefine users (15.1%), followed by cultural sector professionals (11.6%), Linked Open Data / semantic web aficionadas (11.2%), researchers (10.1%) and data scientists (9.5%).\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-communities.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-communities.png)\\n\\nThe vast majority of people use OpenRefine professionally, but 14.9% of our users do indicate that they mainly use the software in their free time. Unsurprisingly, many of them indicate that they are active in the Wikimedia or OpenStreetMap communities.\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-work-free-time.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-work-free-time.png)\\n\\nFor the first time, we asked in which language(s) you use OpenRefine (both its interface and the datasets you interact with). English is dominant with 64.1%; followed by French (9.7%), German (8.1%), Spanish (6.5%) and various other languages (3.2%).\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-languages.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-languages.png)\\n\\n2022 survey respondents use OpenRefine a bit more often than we saw in previous editions.\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-how-often-use.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-how-often-use.png)\\n\\nAnd you are also increasingly becoming OpenRefine \'veterans\', with a solid 66.7% saying that you have used the software for more than two years.\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-how-long-use.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-how-long-use.png)\\n\\nYou are rating your OpenRefine skill level a bit higher than in the past, too.\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-skill-level.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-skill-level.png)\\n\\nYou are using OpenRefine for roughly the same purposes as two years ago. We added \\"data imports from other resources\\" as a new option, and that\'s indeed frequently done. Analyzing existing datasets has become more popular (50.2% now), and preparing datasets before visualization in other applications is done less often (22.16%) than in 2020. Reconciliation (55.1%) also keeps (slowly) growing as a typical activity inside OpenRefine.\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-tasks.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-tasks.png)\\n\\n## What does your OpenRefine installation look like?\\n\\n53.4% of respondents usually update OpenRefine to its current stable release; an additional 23.8% use an earlier version of OpenRefine 3.x.\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-versions.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-versions.png)\\n\\nAs we expected, most people (85%) work with a local version of OpenRefine. However, nearly 10% use, or even run, a version via cloud hosting. We are aware that our users are interested in this, and are curious to see whether this number increases over time.\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-local-hosted.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-local-hosted.png)\\n\\nWhich plug-in(s) or extension(s) do you use in OpenRefine, if any? We have revamped this question a bit compared to previous years, because the OpenRefine extension ecosystem is in constant change. While more than 50% of users are either unaware of the existence of extensions, or don\'t consciously use any, the Wikidata extension (installed by default in OpenRefine) is used by no less than 26.9% of respondents. Other popular extensions are the RDF extension (8%), VIB-Bits (4%), and GeoJSON export (3.4%).\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-extensions.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-extensions.png)\\n\\nAs mentioned above, reconciliation is slowly becoming more and more popular in OpenRefine. The Wikidata reconciliation service (shipped in OpenRefine by default) is quite dominant, used by 49.1% of survey respondents. VIAF (15.4%), the Getty vocabularies, and in-house reconciliation services (8.6%) follow in popularity. Under \\"Other\\", we see a few new responses from our community of users in the biodiversity domain: Bionomia and the GBIF taxonomy.\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-recon.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-recon.png)\\n\\n## How do you perceive OpenRefine?\\n\\nWhich features make you choose OpenRefine over other tools? Many people mention that they appreciate OpenRefine\'s GUI, price (free!), flexibility, power, reconciliation features, and relative ease of use.\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-wordcloud-why.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-wordcloud-why.png)\\n\\nWhich tool(s) would you use if OpenRefine would not be available to you? Excel is a winner here, and quite a few people also mention Python and R. QuickStatements would be an important alternative for Wikimedia and Wikibase users. One user mentions they would \\"sob the entire time\\", which we of course want to prevent.\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-wordcloud-alternatives.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-wordcloud-alternatives.png)\\n\\nHow do you describe OpenRefine to someone else? Many of the descriptions involve the words \\"data\\", \\"powerful\\" and \\"cleaning\\", and we very much appreciate phrases like \\"spreadsheets on steroids\\", \\"the Ferrari of spreadsheets\\", \\"a librarian\'s dream\\", \\"swiss army knife\\", or simply \\"magic\\".\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-wordcloud-describe.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-wordcloud-describe.png)\\n\\nWe received many feature requests as answers to the prompt \\"It would be awesome if OpenRefine...\\". Quite a few of these major requests are very familiar to us, and also mentioned on our [roadmap](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Roadmap).\\n\\n* Support for large datasets with many columns and/or rows (3 requests). Good news: we are working towards this goal for OpenRefine\'s major new 4.x release.\\n* A better UX (3 requests), which makes it easier for newcomers to use OpenRefine (3 requests).\\n* A free online instance of OpenRefine / hosted OpenRefine (3 requests).\\n* Multi-user support in OpenRefine (2 requests).\\n* Better Python support (3).\\n* Allow working with R for syntax based work (2).\\n* More \'point and click\' functions to replace GREL (2).\\n* Some simple data visualizations (2 requests), including the possibility to plot georeferenced data on a map.\\n* Easier import from (2 requests) and reconciliation with external datasets via APIs\\n* A feature to add new rows (2)\\n* Better developed, more explicit and more detailed notifications and warnings (2)\\n\\nSome feature requests are specific to Wikimedia, Wikibase and Wikidata support:\\n* Faster Wikidata upload\\n* The possibility to use OpenRefine for Wikibase editing (note: this is  already possible, see [OpenRefine\'s documentation](https://docs.openrefine.org/next/manual/wikibase/configuration) and [a tutorial on Wikiversity](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/OpenRefine_to_Wikibase:_Data_Upload_Pipeline))\\n* Clearer error messages when Wikidata edits fail\\n\\nSeveral requests relate to reconciliation services:\\n* Faster and more powerful reconciliation\\n* Reconciliation against a SPARQL query\\n* More reconciliation services\\n* Less abandoned extensions and reconciliation services (cleanup of inactive and deprecated ones)\\n\\nSome more requests related to usability and ease of use of OpenRefine:\\n* Drag and drop for columns\\n* Keyboard accessible GUI\\n* Dark mode\\n* A language that is more accessible than regex\\n* Auto-update when new versions become available\\n\\nSome requests relate to the way in which OpenRefine works with, and stores, files:\\n* More transparent way to store files\\n* Integration in OpenOffice/LibreOffice\\n* Dynamic links with Google Sheets\\n\\nRequests related to exporting data:\\n* Improved workflow handling, including import/export and multi-project history\\n* Preserve hierarchical structure of a dataset and export it too\\n* Upload data directly into database\\n* Better encoding of diverse characters during export\\n\\nAnd finally:\\n* More clustering algorithms\\n* Improved record mode\\n* Parse JSON or XML automatically\\n* API calls beyond get\\n* Make OpenRefine suited for georeferencing\\n* More training (including in underrepresented contexts)\\n\\n## Communication, help and support\\n\\n37.1% of survey respondents were unaware that OpenRefine has a user mailing list; 25.2% is subscribed to it. You can find, and subscribe to, the mailing list here: https://groups.google.com/g/openrefine\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-maillist.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-maillist.png)\\n\\nWe asked if respondents would like to communicate with other OpenRefine users online and, if so, which channel(s) they would prefer. An online forum, like GitHub discussions or Discourse (like [recently initiated by the OpenStreetMap community](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2022/03/21/a-new-discussion-forum-for-osm/)) is preferred, but our current [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/openrefine) is also appreciated. Slack, which is heavily used in many professional contexts, comes third. Good news: we are indeed investigating if an online forum, in addition to OpenRefine\'s user mailing list, would be useful and maintainable.\\n\\n[![](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-channels.png)](/img/2022survey/2022-survey-channels.png)\\n\\n## How you want to help OpenRefine\\n\\nFinally, OpenRefine\'s 2022 survey included a question exploring in which ways the community would be willing to help the project. Many individuals and several institutions are interested in donating money, and quite a few people have indicated that they would be willing to translate OpenRefine\'s interface or participate in one of its committees. We thank everyone who expressed interest in this, and will follow up via email where relevant.\\n\\nIf you want to help translating OpenRefine\'s interface to your language, you can actually get started right away!

Quite a few OpenRefine users will be familiar with [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/), the multilingual Linked Open Data knowledge base of the Wikimedia movement. Since 2019, media files (digital photographs, videos, sound files, etc) on Wikimedia Commons, [can also be described with multilingual linked data from Wikidata](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data).\\n\\nOpenRefine already includes support for Wikidata and, more recently, arbitrary Wikibases. The new Structured Data on Commons features in OpenRefine will build further upon this.\\n\\nHere\'s an early preview of structured data for a list of Wikimedia Commons files as displayed in OpenRefine:\\n\\n![Commons files with SDC and Wikitext in OpenRefine](/img/202111-commons-SDC-wikitext.png)"},{"id":"2021/11/05/Project-director","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/11/05/Project-director","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-05-Project-director.md","title":"Now hiring: Part-time Project Director","description":"OpenRefine is seeking a *Part-time Project Director* (paid position).","date":"2021-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4.755,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Antonin Delpeuch"}],"frontMatter":{"author":"Antonin Delpeuch","title":"Now hiring: Part-time Project Director","slug":"2021/11/05/Project-director"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Structured Data on Commons functionalities: welcome to OpenRefine\'s new team members!","permalink":"/blog/2021/12/01/commons-project-team"},"nextItem":{"title":"Announcing our new user manual","permalink":"/blog/2021/07/07/hiring-commons"}},"content":"**OpenRefine is seeking a *Part-time Project Director* (paid position).**\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a powerful tool to clean messy data, popular in a diverse range of communities. It has been serving the needs of journalists, librarians, Wikipedians, scientists for more than ten years and is taught in many curricula and workshops around the world. OpenRefine received a two years grant from the [Silicon Valley Community Foundation](https://www.siliconvalleycf.org/) via the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) under their [Essential Open Source Software for Science](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/) program, specifically focusing on improving Diversity and Inclusion in open source projects.

Currently we just have some Barfoo integration, but this tool is abandoned and does not work well on Windows. There seems to be consensus in the community for using Foobar 4, which would be added in the repository. We would make sure its integration with IntelliJ and Eclipse work well. The bulk of the task is to convert the existing Barfoo files to Foobar\'s format. (...)\\" Please describe why this work is important and an overview of how you approach solving this problem.  \\n\\n**Mailing list thread:** Give a link to the openrefine-dev thread where your proposal was discussed.\\n\\n**Key milestones:** Please break down the work you want to do into small chunks with defined checkpoints (ie: I will do X, and we will know when it is done because an X will appear on the screen)\\n\\n**Timeline:** Is this a 4 week sprint?

The following skills are key:\\n* Ability to write documentation fluently in English. Experience with writing software documentation is ideal but not necessary;\\n* Experience with OpenRefine as a user and ideally as a trainer (writing tutorials, running workshops or developing any other training material);\\n* Familiarity with [GitHub](https://github.com), as documentation changes will be reviewed there, and much of our project planning is also happening there. Our documentation is written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), for which there exists many visual editors (for instance, [plugins to export from Google Docs to Markdown](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607), or the [HackMD online editor](https://hackmd.io/)).\\n\\n## Overview of the work\\n\\nAs part of [our milestones for the EOSS grant](/uploads/czi-eoss-proposal.pdf), we are in the process of migrating our existing documentation from [our GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki) to a dedicated documentation platform. This effort is described in our root planning document and coordinated by Owen Stephens and Antonin Delpeuch. We have identified multiple documentation areas:\\n* **Product reference**, documenting for users all the features offered by the tool in a systematic fashion;\\n* **Technical reference**, aimed at developers, explaining the architecture of the tool;\\n* **Project documentation**, aimed at anyone who wants to contribute code, translations, documentation, user support around OpenRefine;\\n* **Tutorials and how-to guides**, showing by example how the tool can be used for specific data cleaning problems;\\n* **Discussions**, to support users with their specific issues.\\n\\nYou will be working on the **product reference** only. The goal for this documentation is to provide a thorough and systematic description of the behaviour of all user-facing features of the tool, such as:\\n* Operations\\n* Importers\\n* Exporters\\n* GREL functions\\n* Facets\\n* Bundled extensions such as Jython and the Wikidata integration\\n\\nThis reference documentation is meant to support users in their exploration of the tool. Users will typically discover the tool through existing tutorials or workshops: these introductory training materials can refer to the product documentation to help users dive deeper in the concepts demonstrated by the course.\\n\\nThe product reference will be written in Markdown using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Documentation for a sample operation is provided as an example of what we are aiming for:\\n\\n* [Rendered version](https://docs.openrefine.org/operations/key_value_columnize.html)\\n* [Markdown source](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/blob/master/docs/src/operations/key_value_columnize.md)\\n\\nYour task will be to write similar documentation for other functions of the tool.\\n\\n## Compensation and timeline\\n\\nWe have 25,000 USD available to complete these milestones. The payment details will be negotiated with the contractor(s).\\n\\nThe work could be done by a single individual or by a team, depending on the availability of applicants.\\n\\nWe are aiming to hire one or more technical writers for this task by the end of May 2020.\\n\\n## How to respond\\n\\n**Update (2020-05-18):** the application period for this position has lapsed, thank you to everyone who got in touch. We will announce the results in the coming weeks.\\n\\nPlease send your resume or CV, sample of your relevant previous work and a short letter of interest to advisory.committee@openrefine.org.

We take it as a positive fact where we can keep our user base while being able to attract new users. \\n\\nNote that in the below analysis, we included users that never used OpenRefine in the less than six months group (five respondents in 2014, nine in 2018, three in 2020). \\n\\n[![](/img/2020survey/23.png)](/img/2020survey/23.png)\\n\\n## How will you rate your skills using OpenRefine\\n\\nIn all our previous surveys, we asked respondents to rate their skills from one to five. One being a novice in Refine and five being a master. The number of novice respondents dropped in 2020 from 16% to 7%. The skills level is related to the frequency of usage and not to the years of experience.

It would be nice if cell provenance could be accessed programmatically or via the interface. So, for instance, in terms of rewinding to a certain state, it would be nice to know at what step a cell/row/column last changed, or what the previous state of the cell/row/column was, or what the state was at a particular step.\\n\\n\\n## Plugin to support in core\\n\\n\\n* RDF (6 requests)\\n* csv reconcile (5 requests). See ticket [#2003](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/2003) and part of [Google Summer of Code 2020 proposal](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GSoC-2020%C2%A0Ideas#reconciliation-server-within-openrefine)\\n* Vib-bits (3 requests)\\n* NER (3 requests)\\n\\n## Training \\n\\n* Make OpenRefine better known (5 requests)\\n* Make GREL more accessible.

You can view the full details of the [2012](http://googlerefine.blogspot.ca/2012/10/google-refine-usage-survey-results.html) and [2014](http://openrefine.org/blog/2014/08/29/2014-survey-results.html) surveys.\\n\\n## Community you identify with\\n\\nLibrarians and researchers remain the two largest user group with 28.69%  and 15.57% of the respondents (which is consistent with the 2014 results). We can notice the Data Science, and Non-Profit organization groups increased since 2014.\\n\\n[![](/img/2018survey/1.png)](/img/2018survey/1.png)\\n\\n##  How often do you use OpenRefine\\n\\nUsage frequency remains globally the same since 2012, with fewer respondents using it weekly (34.4% vs. 41% in 2014) and more on a monthly basis (42% today vs. 30% in 2014). \\n\\n\\n[![](/img/2018survey/21.png)](/img/2018survey/21.png)\\n\\n\\nThe user base change from daily users to weekly or monthly users.

If we compare to the previous year, we see mostly the drop in user with less than six months of experience. While we cannot provide a reason for the decline, we can suppose it is due to the survey methodology, the maturity of the self-service data preparation markets with alternative tools available to the users or because fewer people have been introduced to OpenRefine over the last year. \\n\\nNote that in the below analysis we included users that never used OpenRefine in the less than six months group (five respondents in 2014, nine in 2018). \\n\\n[![](/img/2018survey/23.png)](/img/2018survey/23.png)\\n\\n## How will you rate your skills using OpenRefine\\n\\nBoth in 2012 and 2014 we asked respondents to rate their skills from one to five. One being a novice in Refine and five being a master. This graph confirms the trends that the community is composed of advanced users with the only a third of them rating their skills at 1 or 2 out of 5.\\n\\n[![](/img/2018survey/24.png)](/img/2018survey/24.png)\\n\\n## Version of OpenRefine\\n\\nThe majority of the respondents use the latest release of OpenRefine (2.8).\\n\\n[![](/img/2018survey/3.png)](/img/2018survey/3.png)\\n\\n## High-level tasks you do with OpenRefine\\n\\nUsage breakdown remains stable compared to the 2012 survey. 87.77% of the respondents are using OpenRefine to address more than one type of task.\\n\\nThe majority of the respondents use OpenRefine to normalize data (80%) and transform it (75%).  We introduced the answer _Preparing a dataset before visualization in another application (R, D3, Tableau, Fusion Table ...)_  in the 2018 survey.\\n\\n[![](/img/2018survey/4.png)](/img/2018survey/4.png)\\n\\nNote: Respondant can select multiple answer.

So far the funds have been used to finance the release of OpenRefine 2.8 and 3.0 (over 150 issues closed!) and covers expenses to present OpenRefine at the [NICAR 18](https://www.ire.org/conferences/nicar18/) and [IRE 18](https://ire.org/conferences/ire-2018/) conferences.\\n\\n## Governance\\n\\nThe [OpenRefine core team](https://github.com/orgs/OpenRefine/people) is currently managing the funds via a private US company to get off the ground quickly. We know that the private US corporation is not a viable solution in the long term and we are currently under discussion to join [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/).\\n\\nAs we begin to use Software Freedom Conservancy as the parent organization of OpenRefine Foundation, we will clarify and formalize our governance model. In the meanwhile, we welcome anyone feedbacks and comments via our GitHub project or our [user](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openrefine) and [developer](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openrefine-dev) mailing lists. If you would like to request financing for the development of a feature, the attendance or the organization of an event, please reach out via one of our mailing lists.\\n\\nYou can review our usage of the funds in the following [Finance document.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hldPOw8W_TGM2DuKWbkFX-rexkQiE5esluZ8buadao/)\\n\\n\\n## OpenRefine roadmap\\n\\nWith the remaining funds available from [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/), we plan to address the tight coupling between the front and back end and set up the OpenRefine Foundation for the next phases. The current implementation presents technical barriers for new contributors to engage with the community and limits the attractiveness of OpenRefine for developers. \\n\\nCurrently, all OpenRefine contributors are working on the project on top of their other academics, professional lives, and family commitments. While the Google funds help the core team to free some extra time to support OpenRefine, part-time involvement is not enough to address coming milestones (after all, we\'re a very small team!). We plan to hire fellow(s) / contractor(s) to work full time for a couple of months with the community and take the lead on the three following items (we will share more information regarding the fellow/contractor positions). \\n\\nYou can track the next phase in the Github project [separation of Front End and Back End](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/projects/5).\\n\\n### Prepare Front / Back-end separation\\n\\nOur goal is to have a full API exposing all OpenRefine operation and commands. This first phase focuses solely on documenting OpenRefine operations and commands available and designing the different API endpoints. The idea is to start small and grow the API over time by allowing for extensibility. In the process, we will take into account existing extensions developed for OpenRefine and support backward compatibility as much as we can.\\n\\n### Datagrid Enhancements\\nA faster grid technology with virtual DOM will set the foundation for faster scrolling, and interactive elements like drag and drop column moving and resizing, and column and row grouping to better support record mode (see the dedicated GitHub project for [UI Improvements](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/projects/2). During the implementation, we can remove the custom bits of the frontend that are coupled directly to the back-end. The new datagrid implementation is tracked via [#1347](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/1347).\\n\\n### Data Storage Enhancements\\n\\nThe group is looking at using Apache Arrow to improve the in-memory data model. An alternative, higher performance in-memory / on-disk data storage technology will help increase OpenRefine\u2019s data processing capacity. The implementation of Apache Arrow is tracked in [#1469](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/1469) and can be done independently from the API and datagrid implementation. \\n\\n\\n### Following Phases\\n\\nFollowing the completion of the three previous phases, we want to: \\n* Implement the new API;\\n* Leverage the new API and datagrid to move away from Jquery-based components and using React or Angular;\\n* Ensure that we have extendable API points for our most important components;\\n* Thanks to the decoupling of the front and back, we can answer the numerous requests from the community to support new data processing engines like Apache Spark or Google DataFlow / DataProc. Those items are tracked in the project [Performance Improvements](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/projects/1);\\n* Keep supporting new features from requested from the community;"},{"id":"2016/03/21/OpenRefine-News-Spring-2016","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2016/03/21/OpenRefine-News-Spring-2016","source":"@site/blog/2016-03-21-OpenRefine%20News%253A%20Spring%202016.md","title":"OpenRefine News: Spring 2016","description":"The OpenRefine community haven\'t been quiet during the Wintes months.

GOKb use OpenRefine (with a specially designed extension) as our major mechanism of getting data into GOKb - exploiting the ability to clean up the data (which tends to come from publishers and can be of variable quality) and to re-apply changes to future data from the same publisher/supplier.\\n\\nGOKb opened to \u2018public preview\u2019 in January 2015, and you can signup for an account and access the service at https://gokb.kuali.org/gokb/\\n\\nSeveral hundred ejournal packages, and associated information about the ejournal titles, platforms and organisations have been added to the knowledgebase over the past few months. OpenRefine is used to do much of the work to get data ready for loading into GOKb.\\n\\nAlongside this work of adding content GOKb have also opened up APIs to interact with the service, which could be useful to others using OpenRefine to work with data relating to journals. In particular the \u2018Coreference service\u2019 allows you to look up identifiers (such as ISSNs) and get back journal title information and other IDs associated with that title (as JSON or XML).\\n\\nThey are interested in:\\n\\n* Talking to people who use OpenRefine and would like to make use of such a service\\n* If there is some interest, what support/documentation people would like to see\\n* Understanding if we can offer different/better services based on the GOKb data for OpenRefine (e.g. would different data GOKb has be of interest? Would a reconciliation service for journal titles? etc.)\\n\\nMore details and join the discussion on the [user mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/openrefine/c_BM4H9jk2o/x4ED1VB_WwUJ)\\n\\n\\n##Workshop and Events\\n\\nOpenRefine Twitter feed have been busy last months with over 12 presentations of OpenRefine made!

As we have seen previously, about 47% of them use it weekly, a third monthly and between 20% and a third less than monthly.\\n\\n[![](/img/2014survey/6.png)](/img/2014survey/6.png)\\n\\n## Seeking support\\n### General overview\\nBy order of importance when people need support\\n- they first learned how to use OpenRefine by themself (91%) using online tutorial or by exploring the interface.\\n- 54% reach to online community (but not the OpenRefine mailing list)\\n- 34% asked someone they know\\n- Only 19% use the mailing list\\n- and 7% have attended a formal training.\\n\\nIt could be interesting to know who are those other online community that provider support for 54% of OpenRefine users.\\n\\n[![](/img/2014survey/71.png)](/img/2014survey/71.png)\\n\\n### Usage of the mailing list\\nWe can notice that only 19% of the user are reaching out through the mailing list which is supposed to be main media of communication for the community. When we drill down on who is using the mailing list we realized that this is mainly user with over a year of experience that are using this media. The graphic below show the percentage of user using the mailing list broke down by how long they have been using OpenRefine.\\n\\n[![](/img/2014survey/72.png)](/img/2014survey/72.png)\\n\\n## Reporting bugs and requesting new features\\nBecause results are similar for the bug reporting and new feature request, the following analysis will be focus only on the bug reporting answers.\\n\\n### Overview\\nClose to 63% of the user are happy with OpenRefine and have nothing to report. However 11% of them want to report something but don\'t know how. Two hypotheses can be explore:\\n- Github is too complex for some user to report issue\\n- The project is missing links and instruction to report issue and request new feature.\\n\\n[![](/img/2014survey/81.png)](/img/2014survey/81.png)\\n\\n### Breakdown per experience with Refine\\nThe following graphic shows that only user with over one year experiences with OpenRefine have reported bug or request new feature. Surprisingly over 60% of the user don\'t know to report something have been using Refine for over a year.\\n\\n[![](/img/2014survey/82.png)](/img/2014survey/82.png)\\n\\n\\n### Breakdown per skills\\nThe following graphic shows that the ability to report is not linked with the skills level since user with a skill level of 4 doesn\'t know how to report. It is interesting that nearly all user self evaluated at 5 did report bug or request feature.\\n\\n[![](/img/2014survey/83.png)](/img/2014survey/83.png)\\n\\nEven user with experience using Refine have difficulties to report bug and request new features. Better guidance is needed and this can be done by either improving\\n- OpenRefine interface with direct link to Github issue list\\n- OpenRefine wiki or website with a page describing the process.\\n\\n\\n## Perception of Refine:\\n### Why did you choose OpenRefine\\nBoth in 2012 and 2014 OpenRefine is chosen for its easy and powerful interface to clean large dataset offering reconciliation option.

But first I\'d like to clarify what I have read on twitter yesterday night. Google Refine has always been an open source tool and anyone can commit changes, develop an extension or update the wiki. \\n\\nThrough this post I\'d like to give my insight on the reason of this decision and what will be the short terms consequences of it. \\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Google Refine Background\\n\\nFirst let\'s do a brief history of Google Refine. Google Refine finds its root in the Freebase Gridworks solution developed by Metaweb Technologies, Inc. in May 2010. From its first version, Freebase Gridworks &nbsp;was an open source project. Initially it was a tool designed to support the [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/) database and community for data cleaning, reconciliation and upload. This historical link with Freebase is still present in Google Refine, as the solution supports reconciliation against Freebase database.\\n\\nIn July 2010 Google [acquired Metaweb](http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2010/07/deeper-understanding-with-metaweb.html) and by extension, Freebase and Gridworks. Freebase Gridworks has been renamed Google Refine and the code and documentation moved to a [code.google.com](http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/) instance. The freshly renamed Google Refine continued to be an open source project for data cleaning. During the 2010 - 2012 period, with the support of Google engineers and the community three upgrade of Google Refine have been made (2.0 ; 2.1 and 2.5). The 2.6 version being on its way (see [this discussion for more details](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/google-refine/2.6/google-refine/Bu_3OOtt_mU/oY9jfM8K_VAJ)).\\n\\nOver the last 16 months editing [this blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.ca), I\'ve seen the tremendous interest for Google Refine from various communities. Librarians, journalists, data analysts have been using Google Refine to clean and reconcile their data. [Reconciliation services](http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/wiki/ReconcilableDataSources) with more databases have been built, &nbsp;an extension to support [RDF extension](http://refine.deri.ie/docs) has been written. A vivid community has emerged opening new horizons to Refine capability.\\n\\nThe user friendly interface helped thousands of non technical users to take control of their data. We are just at the door step of the big data world and Google Refine by lowering the technical barrier to jump in and empower more people for data analysis and processing. As Tom Hirst published today, [Google Refine is a great entry level Glue Logic tool ](http://blog.ouseful.info/2012/10/03/appropriating-it-glue-steps/)to create bridges between various application or system.\\n\\n\\n## Why Google stop supporting Google Refine?\\n\\nGoogle Refine is a desktop based application that can work both offline and online (for reconciliation and web scraping). During the two years Refine was with Google, I didn\'t witness any specific integration with other Google services (like doc, drive or fusion table). Google didn\'t develop Refine as a cloud based solution, to take advantage of its computing capability. I guess that the current desktop architecture of Google Refine prevents such a migration. My bet is that Google bought Metaweb Technologies for Freebase data and not for Gridworks / Refine functionality and today they don\'t see the business case to continue to support Refine.\\n\\n## So, now what?\\n\\nIn the short term, nothing. Google Refine is a stand alone / desktop application, so like most stand alone software, as long as it is installed on your machine, it will run. In a second phase I see two main impacts regarding the end of Google branding and the development of a community supported tool.\\n\\n### The End of Google Branding\\n\\n\\nThanks to Google support, Refine is now one of the most mature data cleaning / wrangling tool available. Google branding also help a lot Google Refine marketing and community building. &nbsp;I suppose that Google name was kind of a guarantee on the product capability and maturity for some users and this naming helped to democratize the tool.\\n\\nHowever, I think that losing Google&#8217;s name will help Refine in two ways:\\n\\n\\n1.  Google branding made many new Refine users think that Refine was a cloud application and that data was uploaded on Google servers. That have never been the case, Refine is a local application. However, some users might have been reticent to use Refine for this reason. Maybe a different branding will make them more confident about their data privacy.\\n\\n2. Reading last nights twitter feed, I realized that most of the people didn\'t know that Google Refine IS already an open tool. I reckon that the Google branding might have confused most of us, myself included (I created this blog because I didn\'t know how to edit the wiki). By naming it OpenRefine (or something else), let\'s hope that more people will engage the community and help with improving it.\\n\\n### OpenRefine - a Community Support Application\\n\\n\\nPlease note that OpenRefine branding is not definitive and [open to discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/google-refine/uDUybfL-7Tc) on the current mailing list. \\n\\nThis new step for Google Refine is also a test on how strong its community is. Will there be enough forces to support, maintain and grow the product from a code, documentation and strategy definition perspective? Organizing the current community and welcoming new users and contributors will be the first challenge of OpenRefine.\\n\\nWe are right now facing a large sheet of white paper, and many things need to be defined from a community management and organization perspective. As the code will be released on Github, little has been defined yet to support the community and articulate the current ecosystem around Google Refine.\\n\\nI will be part of this adventure. If you are interested to jump in, this is the right time.\\n[Join the conversation](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-refine/a3R6afKb4-4) on the mailing list and share your thoughts!"}]}')}}]);

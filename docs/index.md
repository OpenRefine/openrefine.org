<!--
This documentation platform provides a separate version of the user manual for each version of OpenRefine (from 3.4.1 onwards) - if you're looking for a later version than 3.4.1, please select the correct version from the dropdown menu in the top bar of this page.
-->

This user manual starts with instructions for [installing or upgrading OpenRefine on Windows, Mac, and Linux computers](manual/installing.md). It then walks you through [the interface and how to run OpenRefine](manual/running.md#jvm-preferences) from a program or command line, with or without setting custom preferences and modifications.

The manual then teaches you how to [start a project](./manual/starting.md) by importing an existing dataset. We work through how to [view and learn about your data](./manual/exploring.md) using facets, filters, and sorting.

Then we launch into [transforming that data permanently](./manual/transforming.md) through common and custom transformations, clustering, pulling data from the web, [reconciling](manual/reconciling.md), and [writing expressions](manual/expressions.md).

Finally we discuss what to do with your improved dataset, whether [exporting](manual/exporting.md) it to a file or [uploading statements to Wikidata, Wikimedia Commons, or another Wikibase instance](manual/wikibase/overview.md). 

If you're stuck on any aspect and can't find an answer in the manual, try the [Troubleshooting page](manual/troubleshooting.md) for links to various places to find help.

If you are new and want to learn how to use OpenRefine using an example dataset, you may wish to start with a user-contributed tutorial from our [recommendations list](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/External-Resources).

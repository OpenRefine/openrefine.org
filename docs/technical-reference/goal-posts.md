This page is primarily based on the results of the [2024 prioritization survey](https://forum.openrefine.org/t/results-from-the-feature-prioritization-survey-2024/1847). To keep things focused, completed items have been removed. At the end of the list, youâ€™ll also find additional feature requests related to the core product that were not part of the survey but have been raised by the community.

**Score and Status** are defined on the [about goal post page](/docs/technical-reference/about-goal-posts#status-definition).

### Native Reconciliation with arbitrary external datasets
* **Score**:  76
* **Status**: Needs Solution Definition
* **Source**: Prioritization-2024
* Setting up a [reconciliation service](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Reconcilable-Data-Sources#local-services), whether locally or on a server, is complex and often prevents users and organizations with limited technical resources or expertise from leveraging reconciliation features. A built-in (native) capability in OpenRefine to reconcile data against any dataset, such as a local CSV file or another OpenRefine project, would lower the technical barrier. It would allow users to load an authority file as an OpenRefine project and configure the matching criteria in a configuration screen, without relying on external reconciliation services or endpoints.
* Related issue: [#2003](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/2003). See also [Antonin's take on reconciliation](https://antonin.delpeuch.eu/posts/my-roadmap-for-openrefine/#reconciliation) for broader context. 

### Allowing import again for adding new rows to existing projects.
* **Score**:  73
* **Status**: Needs Solution Definition
* **Source**: Prioritization-2024
*  Easy adding of additional rows/importing rows from other datasets. Update existing project with new data (append rows from a file). Extend datasets: add rows to existing datasets from files, assuming the same column structure/order. The inability to update imported data is a limiting factor (user survey)
* Related issue: [#715](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/715)

* **Score**: 68
* **Status**: Needs Scoping
* **Source**: Prioritization-2024

### Better support for OpenRefine extensions
* **Score**: 44
* **Status**: Needs Solution Definition
* **Source**: Prioritization-2024
* Only present maintained and currently operational ones. Improve extension discoverability and ease installation process.
* At the moment extension developers have too few interface stability guarantees, and the user experience of installing and upgrading extensions is poor. There are a lot of open questions around this since OpenRefineâ€™s architecture is quite uncommon, so there does not seem to be an established off-the-shelf model we can adopt.

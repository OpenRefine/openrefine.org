[The OpenRefine Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/2fGTsMdExFEf4ReUNFzB0V/OpenRefine-Outreachy?type=design&node-id=131%3A315&mode=design&t=sqE5Yl0QJtw5TAHy-1) was created by careful analysis of the tool's interactive components, providing helpful reference for designers and contributors regarding the styling, application and integration of components in different user workflow scenarios. 
Designed to ensure consistency and usability, it also serves as a normative document. Use the page navigation in the Figma document to check guidelines for colors, typography styles, individual buttons, complete dialogs and interaction sequences.

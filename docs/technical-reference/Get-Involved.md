## Join the OpenRefine Community

Here's how you can take your first steps to become a part of the OpenRefine design team:

OpenRefine's communication channels are the heart of our collaboration. Join the [OpenRefine forum](https://forum.openrefine.org/), where discussions, announcements, and design-related topics are shared. It is a great place to ask questions, get help, and meet other OpenRefine users and developers.

Once you've joined the forum, take a moment to introduce yourself in the [introduction thread](https://forum.openrefine.org/t/introductions-thread/69). Let us know about your background, interests, and what aspects of design you're passionate about. This is a great way for us to get to know you better and for you to connect with fellow community members.

Check out the available avenues for contributing to the design team. Whether it's enhancing the core design elements, creating visual assets, or collaborating on user experience improvements, there's a role for every design enthusiast.

## Tools
### Figma
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a popular web-based design tool, which is used to document the OpenRefine design system. You don’t have to use it to contribute to the OpenRefine project, but you may want to take advantage of the possibilities to reuse design components in your design work, too. To do that you will need to create a free account, if you don’t already have one. If you need guidance, explore [Figma's Help Center](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us) for tutorials and more to master Figma's features.

### GitHub
GitHub serves as the primary issue tracker for OpenRefine, hosting its codebase. It's worth noting that GitHub's significance extends beyond developers, as users, educators and designers also contribute significantly. 

You can create a free account on [Github.com](https://github.com), if you don’t already have one.
To learn more on how designers can use GitHub, the article  [Git for Designers – All You Need to Know](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/git-for-designers/) by [UXPIN](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/) offers an extensive breakdown of Github.

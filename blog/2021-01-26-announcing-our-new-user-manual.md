The OpenRefine team is delighted to share [our new user manual](https://docs.openrefine.org/)!

This reference covers every aspect of the tool, from installation to exporting a cleaned dataset.

At this point we would like to hear from you: Does this new user manual help you? Did we cover everything you'd expect? Any suggestions to make it better?

We're looking for your feedback on every aspect: the structure, the text, the design, the images, and anything we've missed. We'd especially love to hear from you if you're a new user and are using this manual to install and run OpenRefine for the first time.

We recommend that you start by [following along with the user manual](https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/installing#installing-or-upgrading) to [install or upgrade to the latest version of OpenRefine: version 3.4.1](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/tag/3.4.1). 
Then, try out some tasks alongside the relevant sections of the user manual. Don't try to read the whole thing - just focus on sections that are most important to you.

If you'd like to share your thoughts:
- Please fill out [our feedback form](https://forms.gle/4KkoJFpSrWDMkrh6A). This helps us be sure we're hearing from a broad range of participants. Please fill out the form even if you don't have much to say - we'd love to know if you've taken a look regardless. There is space within the form to report specific requested changes and line edits, as well as give us your general impression.
- You can also suggest edits directly on GitHub (use the "Edit this page" link at the end of each page of the [new docs](https://docs.openrefine.org/)). This will create a pull request with your suggestions; this requires a GitHub account.

We're also asking people who have written tutorials, who give workshops, and who share links on their websites to update those links to point to [docs.openrefine.org](https://docs.openrefine.org). 
While the documentation will always be open to improvements, this is now the authoritative source for information about the tool's functions and features. We will eventually be deleting old pages from the [wiki on Github](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki). 

If you're the author of a tutorial, we will try to get in touch soon to talk to you about updating your documentation online. If you don't hear from us, please reach out! We'd love to chat about the new docs.

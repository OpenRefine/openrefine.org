## About the design role

We're searching for a dedicated part-time designer who will play a leading role in enhancing the usability of OpenRefine. The role requires previous experience with FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and engagement with the diverse communities that intersect with OpenRefine's user base and volunteer contributors.

The new design lead will  be involved in the following:
* Research design limitations and identify opportunities for improvement.
* Designing changes to the user interface to support enhancements and new features.
* Conducting user testing sessions to validate design choices.
* Prioritizing improvements based on user feedback.

We anticipate an initial phase of intense design activity at the project's outset, which will transition to periodic and responsive support as the project advances into the implementation stage.

## Project specifications

The design lead is expected to contribute to:

**Improvements to OpenRefine's Operation History**
As part of a project funded by the [Essential Open Source Software for Science program](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/improving-openrefines-reproducibility/), we are working on improving OpenRefine's operation history and reproducibility guarantees. This work addresses long-standing issues currently tracked in [Improving OpenRefine's reproducibility GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/OpenRefine/projects/6). Specifically:
* Designing graphical representations of sequences of operations to address limitations associated with the Undo/Redo functionality.
* Addressing long-standing issues when reusing and sharing OpenRefine workflows due to the lack of error handling when applying a series of operations and the difficulty of adapting a workflow to a new project 
* Enhancing sharing and reusability of OpenRefine workflows as part of an automated pipeline without using the web interface.

**Ad-Hoc Design Needs**
This includes teaming up with the [@OpenRefine/designers group](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues?q=team%3AOpenRefine%2Fdesigners) and addressing ad-hoc design needs flagged by the community. The lead design role  will be pivotal in refining user interfaces while maintaining design consistency by adhering to and improving OpenRefine's design system and guidelines.

Additional funding or community requests may broaden the scope of the work.


## Skills and Requirements

* Ability to work effectively in a remote, asynchronous environment
* Strong communication skills in English
* Familiarity with version control software (e.g., Github)

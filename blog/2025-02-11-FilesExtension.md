# Files Extension for OpenRefine
OpenRefine provides a powerful feature for generating detailed file information from selected directories in your local system. This functionality allows users to create projects containing comprehensive file metadata.

Features included in this extension:
* Start an OpenRefine project by loading details of files from one or more folders on your local system.
* File details included are file name, extension, size in KB, creation date, last modification date, permissions, SHA-256 checksum, author and file path


It works with **OpenRefine 3.8.7 and later versions of OpenRefine**.

title: "Two Outreachy interns join us for the summer"
---

OpenRefine participates to the [Outreachy](https://outreachy.org) programme, which provides internships to people subject to systemic bias in the technical industry.
We are happy to announce that this summer, we will be hosting two more interns, after participating to previous rounds in 2020 and 2022.

[Lydia Amadi Chinyere](https://github.com/Lydiaofficial) will be joining us to work on improving design workflows in the project and documenting the design patterns currently followed in the application. She will be mentored by [Lozana Rossenova](https://github.com/lozanaross).

[Ayushi Rai](https://github.com/ayushrai206) will help us out with various improvements to our reconciliation features. She will be mentored by [Antonin Delpeuch](https://github.com/wetneb).

We thank all the applicants for their work during the contribution period and encourage them to continue working on free and open source software. The number of interns we can accept is limited by our mentoring capacity. We are also grateful to the [Chan
Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) for funding OpenRefine's participation in Outreachy via a Diversity and Inclusion grant, part of the [Essential Open Source Software for Science](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/) programme.

We are excited to announce the launch of the [OpenRefine Merchandising Store](https://openrefine-shop.fourthwall.com/)! ðŸŽ‰

This new store is a way for our community to access OpenRefine-branded items, show support at events, and help sustain the project.

## Why a store?  

Over the years, community members have often asked us for stickers, shirts, or mugs to represent OpenRefine. At the same time, the project has been looking for new ways to diversify fundraising while keeping operations simple.

The store helps us do both:

- **Merchandising access**: anyone can order OpenRefine items directly, without waiting for an event.
- **Sustainability**: All proceeds go directly toward sustaining the project, supporting new development, and maintaining a tool relied upon worldwide.
- **Simplicity**: items are produced on demand and shipped globally, so there is no inventory to manage or upfront cost.

We considered tying merchandise to sponsorship tiers, but decided to keep things open. Buying merchandise is separate from donations. If youâ€™d like to support OpenRefine financially without buying anything, you can always do so through our [donation page](https://openrefine.org/donate).

## Choosing a platform  

We selected [Fourthwall](https://fourthwall.com/) after reviewing several providers. It offered the right balance of quality and flexibility:

- **Print-on-demand** production (no upfront inventory).
- **Global shipping** and tax handling (including VAT).
- **Promo codes** for special cases, such as at-cost sticker sets for events.
- **Giveaway links**, where OpenRefine can cover 100% of costs when needed.
- **Wide selection of apparel and accessories** with a focus on quality.
- **Integrated donation pages**, so contributions and merchandise can live in one place.

## Whatâ€™s in the store?  

We kept the initial selection small so itâ€™s not overwhelming. Items were chosen for quality and based on community feedback:

- Apparel with high-cotton content (we avoided lower quality polyester blends).
- Stickers, mugs, and other practical items.

During the recent BarCamp, participants helped us test the store and share preferences for items and colors. If you feel something is missing, let us know at martin@openrefine.org. We're happy to adapt based on your feedbacks.


## First feedback  

We soft-launched the store during BarCamp 2025. Early feedback has been encouraging:

- Ordering was smooth and straightforward.
- Shipping and tracking information were reliable.
- Packaging was solid.
- Clothing quality was excellent on first touch.
- The mug survived the dishwasher with no visible wear.

## Whatâ€™s next  

We see this store as an experiment and a service for the community. If it proves useful, weâ€™ll expand it with new designs and products based on your feedback.

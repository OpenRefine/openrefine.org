**OpenRefine is seeking a *Junior Developer - Structured Data on Wikimedia Commons additions to OpenRefine's codebase* (paid contractor position).**

*[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a power tool to clean messy data, popular in a diverse range of communities. It has been serving the needs of journalists, librarians, Wikipedians, scientists for more than 10 years, and is taught in many curricula and workshops around the world.* 
*OpenRefine is quite actively used on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org), the structured data ‘sister’ of Wikipedia. In addition, thanks to a [grant from the Wikimedia Foundation](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Structured_Data_on_Wikimedia_Commons_functionalities_in_OpenRefine), OpenRefine will, between September 2021 and August 2022, be extended with structured data functionalities for [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data), the media repository of the Wikimedia ecosystem. This code extension will make it possible to batch edit structured data of existing files on Wikimedia Commons, and to batch upload new Wikimedia Commons files with structured data from the start.*
*OpenRefine is a fiscally sponsored project of [Code for Science & Society Inc](https://codeforscience.org/), a 501(c)(3) charitable organization in the US.*

The OpenRefine team is seeking a junior developer to help extend OpenRefine’s own code base with the abovementioned functionalities.

* This is a part time, 8 months contract. 
* The work will take 35 weeks, from November 2021 until end June 2022.
* For an average of 30 hours per week.
* Fully remote. We encourage developers from outside of the USA and EU to apply.
* We have between 36,000 USD and 42,000 USD available to complete this assignment, depending on experience. The payment details will be negotiated with the contractor, who will invoice Code for Science & Society for their work towards the corresponding goals.

## Responsibilities

The Junior Developer:

* Reworks OpenRefine’s Wikibase extension to work with any entity type, including the [MediaInfo entity type](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:WikibaseMediaInfo#MediaInfo_Entity) used on Wikimedia Commons.

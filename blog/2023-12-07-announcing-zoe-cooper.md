We are excited to announce that Zoe Cooper has joined the OpenRefine team as lead designer. Following our [job posting in late August](/blog/2023/08/25/reproducibility-designer), Zoe stood out as the perfect person for the role.

Zoe's experience in journalism and publishing, as well as her early career fellowships within  GLAM institutions (the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, and Gagosian Gallery in New York), have given her a deep understanding of the diverse needs of our user base. Zoeâ€™s hybrid career as both designer and writer - her work has been published by Vox, Al Jazeera, Frieze, TASCHEN, AnOther, Disegno: The Quarterly Journal of Design, Flash Art, and more - gives her unique insight into the artistic, scholarly, and scientific communities we serve. As the current part-time design lead for the Zetkin Foundation, a Sweden-based platform for organizing activism, Zoe brings a unique perspective to the OpenRefine team.

As OpenRefine's lead designer, she will initially focus on improving the platform's Operation History as part of a project funded by the [EOSS-5 grant](/funding#2022-eoss-5). She will also continue to develop OpenRefine's design practice, following the work initiated by Lozana Rossenova and Lydia Amadi Chinyere through last summer's [Outreachy internship](/blog/2023/05/05/outreachy-interns).

As we embark on this exciting journey with Zoe, we invite the OpenRefine community to welcome our newest team member warmly. We are thrilled to have her on board and look forward to the exciting things she will bring to the OpenRefine team. Stay tuned for updates on our progress, and thank you for your continued support!

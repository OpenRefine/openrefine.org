OpenRefine will be offering internships as part of the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) this year.
<!--truncate-->
For prospective interns, this is an opportunity to get familiar with open source development with a paid and fully remote internship.
We have proposed [a selection of possible internship topics](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GSoC-Outreachy-2024-Ideas), but applicants are also welcome to propose other areas to work on.
We would also welcome seasoned OpenRefine contributors to propose internship subjects and mentor interns.
For users, this is a good opportunity to request small changes to the tool, as applicants are looking for good first issues to tackle during the application phase. This week's community meetup was
the occasion to make applicants and users meet, to exchange ideas of improvements to OpenRefine. A [similar meeting](https://forum.openrefine.org/t/openrefine-community-meetup/1276/2) will happen on March 29th, 07:00 UTC.

We are very grateful for all the contributors who already started contributing and everyone who helped welcome them to the project! Further coordination of our participation to the programme is happening [on the forum](https://forum.openrefine.org/t/gsoc-2024-contributor-application-period/1246).

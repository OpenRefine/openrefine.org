---
The OpenRefine Advisory Committee is excited to announce that we are now recruiting new members.

As a key part of our [governance structure](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md), the Advisory Committee runs the administrative aspect of the project on a day to day basis with the support of our fiscal sponsor, [Code for Science and Society](https://www.codeforsociety.org/) (CS&S). Its members are bound by the fiscal sponsorship agreement with Code for Science and Society. The committee meets weekly including once per month with Code for Science and Society. Weekly calls are [open to the OpenRefine community](https://forum.openrefine.org/t/opening-advisory-committee-call-to-the-community-permanently/2029). We invite interested candidates to join us for a first-hand experience of the advisory committee's daily operations work.

So far we have interviewed users who expressed an interest in joining the Advisory Committee when filling out the [2024 User Survey](/blog/2024/12/20/2024-survey-results), and we are excited to hear from other community members who may be interested in joining the Committee.

## Advisory Committee responsibilities
- Provide guidance and oversight of the Project’s staff and operations;
- Help the community apply for funding (grants) and manage awarded funds (note: the Project Manager does the majority of this work when that position is staffed)
- Ensure the project’s financial sustainability by searching for new sources of funding;
- Approve budgets and contracts including terminating contracts when necessary;
- Advocate for the Project and help the Project build connections and partnerships;

## Ideal candidates:
- Are users of OpenRefine;
- Are active community members;
- Are familiar with open-source software development and community-driven projects;
- Are passionate about promoting open data and data literacy;
- Are able to commit to regular meetings and contribute to discussions through video meetings, the [OpenRefine Forum](https://forum.openrefine.org/), and on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenRefine).

To ensure a balanced representation of the [diverse community](https://openrefine.org/usage) OpenRefine serves, we seek members from at least one of the following communities.
- OpenRefine Developer
- Journalists/data journalists
- Data Science

For us, your motivation is as important as your resume. We explicitly welcome applicants who do not meet all requirements. We would also be happy to learn more about additional skills and attributes you possess that are not listed here but could be relevant to the advisory committee.

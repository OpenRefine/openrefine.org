title: "AI Extension for OpenRefine"
---
The OpenRefine AI Extension bridges the power of modern language models with OpenRefine's robust data transformation capabilities. This extension enables users to leverage any LLM provider that supports a chat completion API endpoint, bringing AI-powered data wrangling, enhancement, and analysis directly into your OpenRefine workflows.

## Purpose
The extension serves multiple purposes in the data processing pipeline:

1. Intelligent Data Cleaning: Use LLMs to suggest and implement context-aware data cleaning operations that go beyond rule-based approaches.
2. Semantic Enrichment: Enhance datasets by generating additional attributes or metadata based on existing content.
3. Natural Language Transformations: Express complex data transformations in plain English.
4. Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual patterns or outliers in your data through AI-powered analysis.
5. Content Generation: Fill gaps in your datasets with contextually appropriate synthetic data.


It works with **OpenRefine 3.8.7 and later versions of OpenRefine**.

We will hold [an in-person meeting around OpenRefine](https://openrefine.github.io/BarCamp2024/) on June 17th-19th in Berlin, Germany.
We hope to gather many interested OpenRefine community members, partners and stakeholders who want to help shape the projectâ€™s future.
Remote attendance will be possible too.

Co-organizers for this event would be welcome. If you would like to help shape the BarCamp, please let us know [on the forum](https://forum.openrefine.org/t/organizing-an-openrefine-barcamp/179/35).

More details will follow. For now, just save the date!

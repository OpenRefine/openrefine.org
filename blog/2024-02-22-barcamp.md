We will hold [an in-person meeting around OpenRefine](https://openrefine.github.io/BarCamp2024/) on June 17th-19th in Berlin, Germany.
We hope to gather many interested OpenRefine community members, partners and stakeholders who want to help shape the project’s future.
Remote attendance will be possible too.

Co-organizers for this event would be welcome: if you want to help shape this event, let us know [on the forum](https://forum.openrefine.org/t/organizing-an-openrefine-barcamp/179/35).

More details will follow: for now, just save the date!

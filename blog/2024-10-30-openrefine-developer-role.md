## Work Environment & Reporting Structure

This is a fully remote role with flexible working hours, allowing the developer to organize their time freely over the month. The OpenRefine Developer will primarily work with volunteers, including members of the Advisory Committee and most technical contributors. The OpenRefine community collaborates asynchronously through public forums and GitHub, accommodating the diverse time zones and work patterns of contributors. Occasional travel may be expected to attend relevant conferences and meetings, enabling valuable in-person engagement with the OpenRefine community and the broader open-source ecosystem.

The developer will report to the Project Manager, which will guide project goals and prioritization. For technical supervision and mentorship, the developer will collaborate closely with the OpenRefine Committer Group—comprising both volunteer contributors and paid contractors—to facilitate their integration with the codebase and OpenRefine’s development standards.

This role requires a self-motivated, independent approach, with minimal direct supervision. Weekly check-ins with the Advisory Committee and Project Manager will provide alignment with OpenRefine’s broader objectives and ongoing support as needed.

## Skills 
* **Java Proficiency**: As OpenRefine’s core codebase is Java, strong experience in Java is crucial.
* **Web Development**: Familiarity with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for front-end adjustments and minor feature development.
* **Git and GitHub Expertise**: Proficient with Git for version control and GitHub workflows (pull request reviews, branch management, release workflows).
* **Self-Motivated and Adaptable**: Comfortable working independently in a remote setting, with a proactive approach to problem-solving.
* **Community-Driven and Collaborative**: Experience engaging constructively in a collaborative, open-source environment.
* **Effective Communication**: Strong written communication skills for explaining technical concepts clearly to community members, volunteers, and contributors.

Nice to have
* **Open-Source Experience**: Prior contributions to or maintenance of open-source projects.
* **Release Management Familiarity**: Some experience with release processes, ideally including automated build and deployment systems.
* **Data Processing Knowledge**: Familiarity with data cleaning, transformation, or processing concepts relevant to OpenRefine’s core use cases.

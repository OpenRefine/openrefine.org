## Work Environment & Reporting Structure

This is a fully remote role with flexible working hours, allowing the developer to organize their time freely over each month. This role requires a self-motivated, independent approach, with minimal direct supervision. The OpenRefine Developer will primarily work with volunteers, including members of the Advisory Committee and most technical contributors. The OpenRefine community collaborates asynchronously through public forums and GitHub, accommodating the diverse time zones and work patterns of contributors. Occasional travel may be expected to attend relevant conferences and meetings, enabling valuable in-person engagement with the OpenRefine community and the broader open-source ecosystem.

The developer will report primarily to the Project Manager, who will provide guidance on project goals and prioritization. Additionally, the OpenRefine Advisory Committee will serve as a resource for strategic direction and administrative support in collaboration with Code for Science & Society Inc. Weekly check-ins with the Advisory Committee and Project Manager will give the OpenRefine Developer the chance to report back on their work, gain an understanding of OpenRefine’s broader objectives, and receive ongoing support as needed.

For technical supervision and mentorship, the developer will work closely with the OpenRefine Committer Group, which consists of both volunteer contributors and paid contractors. This collaboration will help the developer integrate into the codebase and adhere to OpenRefine's development standards. The Committer Group is responsible for setting the project's technical roadmap and reviewing merge requests.

## Skills 

Required:
* **Java Proficiency**: As OpenRefine’s core codebase is Java, strong experience in Java is crucial.
* **Web Development**: Familiarity with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for front-end adjustments and minor feature development.
* **Git and GitHub Expertise**: Proficient with Git for version control and GitHub workflows (pull request reviews, branch management, release workflows).
* **Self-Motivated and Adaptable**: Comfortable working independently in a remote setting, with a proactive approach to problem-solving.
* **Community-Driven and Collaborative**: Experience working collaboratively in open-source or community-driven projects, with the ability to engage and motivate volunteers.
* **Mentorship and Collaboration**: Demonstrated ability to mentor contributors, provide constructive feedback on pull requests, and foster a supportive, growth-oriented environment.
* **Effective Communication**: Strong written communication skills for explaining technical concepts clearly to community members, volunteers, and contributors.

Nice to have:
* **Open-Source Experience**: Prior contributions to or maintenance of open-source projects.
* **Conference and Public Speaking**: Willingness to present OpenRefine at conferences, meetups, and workshops to promote the project and attract new developers.
* **Release Management Familiarity**: Some experience with release processes, ideally including automated build and deployment systems.
* **Data Processing Knowledge**: Familiarity with data cleaning, transformation, or processing concepts relevant to OpenRefine’s core use cases.

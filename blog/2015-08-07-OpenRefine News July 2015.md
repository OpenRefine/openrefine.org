## Development Update

Through July we received five pull request including four toward the 2.6 release. Those are currently under review and should be merged shortly.  

[Qi Cui](https://github.com/jackyq2015) can now apply milestones and labels on the OpenRefine issue. Over 20 new issues have been opened last month and an extra person to help with the triage is more than welcome. Thank you to everyone who took the time to open issue and report bugs. 

The wikidata team start setting up a [reconciliation service for OpenRefine](https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-reconcile/). This is a work under progress and the API implementation is incomplete. Things may change or stop working at any time. You can join the discussion on the [wikimedia discussion list](https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikidata/2015-July/006776.html)

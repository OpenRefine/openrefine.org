title: "2025 Fundraising Campaign Results"
---
As we close the 2025 community giving campaign, I want to take a moment to share the results, reflect on what we learned, and thank everyone who supported OpenRefine over the past few months.

This campaign was one part of a broader effort to better understand how community giving and merchandise sales can contribute to OpenRefine’s sustainability, alongside grants and institutional funding. It was also our **first time running a structured community giving campaign**, and the results provide a useful benchmark if we decide to repeat this exercise in the coming years.

## Campaign results

Outside of the FLOSS/fund contribution, the campaign raised approximately **USD 595** through a combination of one-time donations, store sales, and new recurring support.

### One-time donations

We received **five one-time donations**, for a total of **USD 317.21**.
Four donations came through the donation page, and one came via the store checkout.

### Merchandise store

During the campaign period, the [OpenRefine store](https://store.openrefine.org/en-cad) recorded **13 orders**, representing:

* **USD 899.86** in total sales
* **USD 107** in total profit
* **USD 69.22** average order value
* **11.89%** average profit per sale

The most popular items were:

* [OpenRefine Logo Sticker Sheet](https://store.openrefine.org/en-cad/products/openrefine-logo-sticker-sheet-9)
* ["OpenRefine is Magic" Sticker Sheet](https://store.openrefine.org/en-cad/products/openrefine-is-magic-sticker-sheet-9)
* T-shirts (all designs combined)
* Hoodies (all designs combined)
* [OpenRefine Black Mug](https://store.openrefine.org/en-cad/products/openrefine-mug-black-with-openrefine-is-magic-logo)

The store continues to be a useful way for people to support the project and show affiliation, even if it remains a modest source of funding.

### Github Sponsor Recurring donations

We welcomed **one new recurring donor** at **USD 10 per month** on our [GitHub Sponsor page.](https://github.com/sponsors/OpenRefine) OpenRefine now has **eight recurring donors**, contributing **USD 67 per month**, or approximately **USD 804 per year**.

### Overall total

Combining one-time donations, store profit, and the three months of the new recurring donation, the campaign raised approximately **USD 595.21**.

## Outreach and engagement

To support the campaign, we reached out to the community through:

* **Banner** on OpenRefine website homepage
* **Two emails** sent to approximately **265 community members**
* A limited number of **social media posts** across LinkedIn, Mastodon, and X
* Ongoing **forum updates** focused on transparency around funding efforts

We **did not run the campaign using OpenRefine notification**, which is something we may explore in future outreach efforts.

While the financial outcome was modest, the campaign provided useful insight into engagement patterns and how different parts of the community prefer to support the project.


## What we learned

This campaign confirmed something we already suspected: **community giving alone is not sufficient to sustain the OpenRefine core team**. While community support remains important, long-term sustainability will continue to depend primarily on grant funding and institutional partnerships aligned with OpenRefine’s mission.

We will continue to explore these funding paths and share progress transparently as we refine our approach.

## Thank you

Thank you to everyone who contributed, shared the campaign, bought something from the store, or followed along. OpenRefine exists because of its community, and your engagement continues to shape the project in important ways.

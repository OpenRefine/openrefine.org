We found this story really interesting and how [@KatieLaGrone](https://twitter.com/KatieLaGrone) and [@WPTVTNIELS](https://twitter.com/WPTVTNIELS) used [OpenRefine to study DUI crashes.](http://www.wptv.com/news/local-news/investigations/the-story-behind-the-story-dui-crashes-with-injuries-on-area-roads-and-intersections) 

[@importio](https://twitter.com/importio) put  together an excellent list of [all the best big data tools and how to use them](http://blog.import.io/post/all-the-best-big-data-tools-and-how-to-use-them). Of course OpenRefine is one of them!

## Development Update

We received two majors contributions last month. 
First [@k_grons](https://twitter.com/k_grons) [@cora_jr](https://twitter.com/cora_jr) and [@roellephant](https://twitter.com/roellephant) built a new cluster export feature for OpenRefine. Their pull request is under review but you can test it right away [from their repository](https://github.com/amiaopensource/OpenRefine/releases/tag/2.6%2Bamia).

[@pm5](https://twitter.com/pm5) started a Node.js [client library for controlling OpenRefine](https://github.com/pm5/node-openrefine) similar to the existing one in ruby and python.



## November Events Recap:

There was a rather interesting event organized by [James Baker](https://twitter.com/j_w_baker) hashtag #libraraycarpentry, which was a program for introductory software skills. With better software comes better research, aimed at librarians, four sections three-hour introductory workshop held at the City University London Centre over a period of four weeks.

The numbers they got from the event are amazing to see, the event looks like it was very popular and well executed. The concept behind this workshop was to highlight the needs and requirements of library professionals that do not currently exist, detailed in James Bakers [final report of the event.](http://cradledincaricature.com/2015/12/01/library-carpentry-in-words-and-numbers-all-code-no-woodwork/) If you want greater details and more information i would strongly suggest having a look at the course content shared on [GitHub.](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/week-four-library-carpentry)

Another popular event that happened last month was the Semantic Web In Libraries Conference  [(SWIB15)](http://swib.org/swib15/) in Hamburg. The SWIB conference was aimed to provide substantial information on LOD developments relevant to the library world and to foster the exchange of ideas and experiences among practitioners. A large number of participants showed up from over 29 different countries really successful meet-up here. [Rurik Greenall](https://twitter.com/brinxmat) posted a report on the event itself which is a solid read on his [blog.](https://brinxmat.wordpress.com/2015/11/26/swib15/)

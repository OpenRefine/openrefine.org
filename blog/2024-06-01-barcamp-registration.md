Our first ever BarCamp is coming up in two weeks, on June 17th-19th, in Berlin and online.
If you haven't yet, [register now](https://barcamps.eu/openrefine-2024-barcamp/) to participate, whether you want to attend onsite or remotely.
This will give you access to the video conference room, let you propose and vote on sessions.

The event will start Monday afternoon:
* 14:00 CEST (12:00 UTC): Introductions round and opening of the event.
* 14:30 CEST (12:30 UTC): Collaborative review and scheduling of [the proposed sessions](https://barcamps.eu/openrefine-2024-barcamp/sessions) (which you can still submit).
* 16:00 CEST (14:00 UTC): Break
* 16:30 CEST (14:30 UTC): Allocation of [volunteering shifts](https://github.com/OpenRefine/BarCamp2024/issues/11) (session facilitation, note-taking, Zoom caretaking)

The sessions themselves will then take place on Tuesday and Wednesday, following the schedule established on Monday. The schedule will be published on the BarCamp's website.

We are looking forward to kicking off this gathering with you!

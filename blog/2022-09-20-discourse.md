**tl;dr We consider moving OpenRefine's mailing lists and Gitter to a web-based Discourse forum, and invite your feedback.**

*This message has also been posted on OpenRefine's [user](https://groups.google.com/g/openrefine) and [https://groups.google.com/g/openrefine-dev/](https://groups.google.com/g/openrefine-dev/) mailing lists on September 20, 2022.*

For quite a while, some active OpenRefine community members ([Antonin](https://github.com/Antonin Delpeuch), [Sandra](https://github.com/Sandra Fauconnier), and the [OpenRefine advisory committee](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md)) have been talking about ways to make OpenRefine’s community more lively, active and diverse.

As one step, we consider moving the current main community communication channels (the [user mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/openrefine), [developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/openrefine-dev/), and the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/OpenRefine/OpenRefine)) to a public, web-based forum, using the [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) software. After the move, we will not delete the mailing lists, but  keep them read-only as a public archive. We feel inspired to move  forward to this, because in [our latest user survey (held in April-May 2022)](https://openrefine.org/blog/2022/06/28/2022-survey-results.html), a web-based forum was the most popular option when we asked you for your preferred means of communications.

Our choice would be a [hosted web-based Discourse forum](https://www.discourse.org/pricing), on a URL like forum.openrefine.org or similar. We would go for  Discourse for many reasons. First, because it is well-designed and  widely used open source forum software, but (among other things) also  because it allows much more diverse discussion on 'smaller' topics (e.g. translation of OpenRefine's interface; discussion about larger feature  requests; threads in languages other than English...). Discourse offers  mailing list / email modes for people who prefer this as their main mode of communications.

**[We collected many considerations and pros/cons in this document, including the other options we could consider.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PY0T6dudVO6iQAbf1EUEdL1UTHu7eSFamJjL22ELMEI/edit)** We invite your comments and feedback [there](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PY0T6dudVO6iQAbf1EUEdL1UTHu7eSFamJjL22ELMEI/edit), or on OpenRefine's mailing list. Also, if anyone is interested in helping with the move, please let me know :-)

Tentative timeline for the move (our team is small, so this may be slower, or faster if a few of you volunteer to help!):
- September 20, 2022 - OpenRefine’s community is informed about this plan; you can respond and comment for two weeks (and longer if we notice it is needed)
- Week of Oct 3, 2022 (or later) - Decision go/no go based on your feedback
- If there is general consensus: around the first weeks of November  (depending on availability of Antonin, Sandra and volunteers) - start of actual migration to Discourse
- If there is general consensus: end November 2022 - OpenRefine’s  community uses Discourse for communications and mailing lists are now  read-only!

Looking forward to your comments and feedback!

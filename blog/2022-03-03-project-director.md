OpenRefine’s advisory committee is happy to welcome [Sandra Fauconnier](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:SFauconnier) as OpenRefine’s project director. This is a part time position, funded by an [Essential Open Source Software for Science grant awarded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/openrefine-for-everyone/).
<!--truncate-->
In this new role, Sandra will work closely with OpenRefine’s advisory and steering committees, and with its communities of users and contributors. She will help to improve our governance and community diversity, build community-driven structures to formalize OpenRefine’s roadmap and keep it up to date, will help us find and secure new sources of funding, and will support the advisory committee in OpenRefine’s day-to-day operations.

Sandra started using OpenRefine in 2015, and is currently using it in her free time on a nearly daily basis, mainly for batch editing data on Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons. As an art historian and active Wikimedia volunteer, she has lots of affinity with OpenRefine’s users from the cultural sector, libraries, and the Wikimedia movement. Since July 2021 she has been working with the OpenRefine team as project manager/product owner on our [grant with the Wikimedia Foundation to develop integration with Wikimedia Commons](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/CS%26S/Structured_Data_on_Wikimedia_Commons_functionalities_in_OpenRefine).

Sandra is keen to get to know very diverse members from OpenRefine’s community. [Here](https://hackmd.io/JgmAzY_9RwCilSQIxkNChA?view) you find an open invitation, and various ways to contact her.

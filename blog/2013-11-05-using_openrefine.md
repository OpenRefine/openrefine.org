_“How do I get started?”_ is the question we received most
during our hands-on workshops on data cleaning and enhancing.
OpenRefine is a very powerful tool in the hands of a skilled user,
but how do you become one?
There is a [wiki](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki),
several [screencasts](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Screencasts),
and a list of helpful [resources](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/External-Resources).
However, until recently, no complete OpenRefine manual existed,
so you had to collect documentation from different sources
if you wanted to master OpenRefine.

[![Using OpenRefine book cover](/img/using-openrefine.jpg)](/img/using-openrefine.jpg)
This is why we've written an OpenRefine manual called [_Using OpenRefine_](http://www.packtpub.com/openrefine-guide-for-data-analysis-and-linking-dataset-to-the-web/book)
that leads you from your first steps
to all advanced OpenRefine topics.
Using the [entire dataset of the Powerhouse Museum](http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/download.php),
it lets you experience OpenRefine techniques in a hands-on way,
starting from creating a project and inspecting data
and gradually evolving towards complex operations.
Rather than being a one-directional text,
this book offers detailed recipes you can pick whenever you need them.

**In particular, you'll learn about these topics in _Using OpenRefine_:**

- importing data in various formats
- exploring datasets in a matter of seconds
- applying basic and advanced cell transformations
- dealing with cells that contain multiple values
- creating instantaneous links between datasets
- filtering and partition your data easily with regular expressions
- using named-entity extraction on full-text fields to automatically identify topics
- performing advanced data operations with the General Refine Expression Language

**Get started with OpenRefine right way—for free**

Download the entire [second chapter of the book](http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/9781783289080_Chapter_02.pdf "Chapter 2 of Using OpenRefine") for free,
so you can already learn about _sorting_, _facets_, _filters_, _duplicates_, and more.
It's the fastest way to get you up to speed with OpenRefine.

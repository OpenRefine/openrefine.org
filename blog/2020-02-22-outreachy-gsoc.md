OpenRefine will offer internships via the [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) and [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) programs this year.

For Outreachy, pre-applications are still open and [our proposed projects](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection/#openrefine) will be revealed on March 5th.

For the Google Summer of Code, check out [our organization page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5904592325312512/) and our [project ideas](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GSoC-2020%C2%A0Ideas).

We are short of mentors - if you want to help with mentoring students for the Google Summer of Code, do add yourself to the project ideas (on existing projects or on additional ones).

title: "X joins us as a Google Summer of Code contributor"
---

The OpenRefine project participates in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program, which provides remote internships in software development on open source projects.
We are happy to announce that for this year's cohort, we will be joined by X, who has applied to work on Y.
He will be mentored by [Antonin Delpeuch](https://github.com/wetneb).

Please welcome X in the community! Why don't you introduce yourself to them, explaining what you are doing in OpenRefine and why?

We thank all the applicants for their work during the contribution period and encourage them to continue working on free and open source software. The number of interns we can accept is limited by our mentoring capacity.

title: "Zyad joins us as a Google Summer of Code contributor"
---

The OpenRefine project participates in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program, which provides remote internships in software development on open source projects.
We are happy to announce that for this year's cohort, we will be joined by [Zyad Taha](https://github.com/zyadtaha), who has applied to work on improvements to clustering.
He will be mentored by [Antonin Delpeuch](https://github.com/wetneb).

Please welcome Zyad in the community! Why don't you [introduce yourself to him](https://forum.openrefine.org/u/zyadtaha), explaining what you are doing in OpenRefine and why?

We thank all the applicants for their work during the contribution period and encourage them to continue working on free and open source software. The number of interns we can accept is limited by our mentoring capacity.
